4/3/2025 group 7 meeting notes

this week, we:
- created the 3 basic pages for the website
- implemented post creation logic
- working on login logic
- database schema implemented
- matt did header and schema
- juan did the footer
- Juan started implementing logout routes
- automated github release notes

this next week, we will:
- kyle helps Juan with login routes, Juan finishes logout routes
- kyle sets up pop-ups when clicking on pin
- Cali generates dummy data (copy google image links onto entries) posts, add lat long attribute
- need way to store images that user submits - new idea: users don't need to be able to upload new images, just can comment on existing posts - we can use one drive as potential storage option for blob storage / pull link from drive
- role-based authentication: you can access pinmap and look at posts from pinmap / look at user pages without an account, but you need an account to like or comment 
- adding sql triggers to track accounts followers/following, how long they've been active, like counts
