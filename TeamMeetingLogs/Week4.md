last week we:
kyle fixed testing, added npm run testing command, fixed registration routes
matthew made popup display and comment display
juan implemented comment functionality 
cali got database post data to render into map pins 
andrew updated pull request he had up


this week we will:
- flesh out 'my account page' with connection to database info and post catalogue of posts connecting to that user
- matthew will make the logout page pretty

to implement follower/following have another table for follower to following connection, then add follow button to map page cards 
(instructor grades based on how many unique features are included so implementing follower feature is good for grade, along with other stuff on profile page)
(when talking about project, explain everything as different unique features [map, profile page, following, comment functionality, etc]) - try to emphasize the amount of work you did in this project
